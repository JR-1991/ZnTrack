Welcome to PyTrack's documentation!
===================================
PyTrack is build to help you write code that can easily be shared and reproduced.
It uses `Data Version Control <https://dvc.org/>` to track generated files and parameters.
PyTrack is designed as a developer package aiming to be used in other software packages.
If you are not planning on writing such packages we highly recommend looking up DVC first.

PyTrack might still be helpfull for you, because it provides an Object Oriented Mapper for DVC.
Please have a look at the Tutorials and Documentation for detailed information or write an issue on Github for https://github.com/zincware/py-track
